# Project---Meetup-Professional-Growth-

this is the description of the project. i am simply here to create a todo list like im required to.

This is INDIVIDUAL work

Evaluations Guidelines (see Canvas Rubric)
Start: Start of Class
Due: April 11 at 11pm IMPORTANT: you should post right away when you are done AND email everyone in class your link to your YouTube URL
Points 70



Goal: An important purpose of this course is to enable the students to develop analysis skills to make decisions on ethical issues in their field. Part of this as a student is becoming more familiar with the specific fields within Computing. To do so, I am asking you to PART A: attend a meetup (meetup.com) in computer science and report AND PART B: attend a local CSUEB tech club event/meeting AND join Github AND join Stackoverflow AND ChatGPT



Assignment: You must do ALL PARTS



IMPORTANT: these groups do not have meetings all the time, It could be even less frequent than once a month depending on your selection. SO YOU must start this right away and try to find meetings and events that will take place before Oct. 3. I suggest doing this as soon as possible in case of cancelations, etc.



IMPORTANT: Make sure in the creation of your slide deck that you create slides with sufficient detail in them as I would like the slide deck to be understood even without the presentation.


Project Details



IMPORTANT: I want the slides you create to be VERY detailed --I want all the information you are going to discuss to be text on the slides themself. This is why it says slide X+ this means you will need more than one slide to create this content.



PART A: Meetup
1) Become a member of meetup.com
2) Become a member of a meetup on meetup.com that is in the area of Computer Science. I strongly suggest as we discussed in class choosing a topic/area you may be interested in working in. Some areas could be: "Web Systems/programming", "Data / Database/ Big Data", "Computer Networks", "Gaming", "Programming in X (where X is a language)", "Software Development/Engineering", "Mobile Programming", "Game Programming", "Computers and X (X = gaming, medicine, networks, audio, vision, entertainment, AND SO ON)".
3) After joining at least one group (see number 2) you are to attend a meetup/meeting (currently meetups are mostly virtual and this is what I want you to do for safety)
4) TAKE NOTES AND YOU MUST "MEET" ONE PERSON PROFESSIONAL AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT CS FIELDS/JOBS/TOPICS BEING DISCUSSED.
5) Create a slide deck containing the following slides: (NOTE you can have more than one slide for each of the following --this is most probably true for a discussion of what was said/ covered in the meetup). In deliverables discuss the YouTube video will create for presenting your slide deck.
NOTE: when you see SlIDE X+ it means you may have/need more than one slide for the content

SLIDE 1: Name of Meetup group, URL to Meetup group - show screenshot of the Meetup group
SLIDE 2: Title of meeting, Location, Date and Times
SLIDE 3+: List of presenter(s) and who they are (where they work, what they do)
SLIDE 4+: Discussion of what was said
SLIDE 5+: Who you met ---tell us about who you met at the meetup and give answers to at least ONE question you have asked that person.
SLIDE 6+: What did you think--- how did you like it, was it bad/good or ???, what did you learn, would you go again, would you look for a different group?



PART B: other memberships - Getting Engaged in Technology
1) Attend a meeting or event held by a campus tech-related organization like our IEEE club or ACM-W club. Take a screenshot of the webinar/zoom meeting when it is in progress

SLIDE 7+: screenshot at a meeting/event and name and details of the event you attended and summary of what happened
NOTE: when you see SlIDE X+ it means you may have/need more than one slide for the content

2) get an account on Stackoverflow and look around and see what kinds of questions related to ONE technical course you either are currently taking or recently took and take a screenshot of that question and answer.

SLIDE 8+: snapshot of your Stackoverflow question/answer you found and discuss how it is related to some course you are taking, did you learn something from the answers given
NOTE: when you see SlIDE X+ it means you may have/need more than one slide for the content

3) get an account on github.com and create an issues board for this Meetrup Assignment (make a card for each sub-task of this assignment) and give a due date for each ) and do a screenshot.

SLIDE 9: screenshot of your account. AND a brief summary of what github.com is

4) get an account on chatgpt.com (FREE only) and try to take the question you found posted on Stackoverflow in number 2 and ask chatgpt this question. Show a screenshot of the results and compare the two. Try to ak ChatGPT some follow up questions.

SLIDE 10+: screenshot of your chatGPT session AND a brief discussion comparing the chatGPT results and StackOverflow for the same question.

Deliverables:

April 11 at 11pm

Create the Slide Deck AND create a PDF of the slides. Also create a YouTube video (must include legible text on screen and clear audio of you discussing the slides) with a minimum of 3 minutes and a maximum of 8 minutes that contains SLIDES 1-10+ discussed above and post so can be viewed by all. (note: you will have more than 10 slides most likely to represent the required content.

Upload PDF of the Slide Deck AND the YouTube URL (make it public so others in the class can see) to Canvas->Assignments->Meetup+
